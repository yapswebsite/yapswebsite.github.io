						<summary>Royston's Thoughts</summary>
						<p>
							<h4>What I learned & how this program benefited me:</h4></br>
							Winnie and her team have been fantastic in getting very high calibre clients like Humanitix and Draw History, this provides a very rewarding and high quality experience that is hard to gained as a student. 
							</br>
							I’ve learned plenty from YAPS’ CLAP program. The case that was written for Humanitix was absolutely incredible. The information, data, and questions we need to digest and solve mimic a real life case that one will be doing in a top management consulting firm. The rich quality of problem presented as well as the thought-provoking questions to solve really forces you to upskill yourselves and provide results that are as excellent as the case given.</br></br>
							<h4>Key learnings I took away from CLAP:</h4></br>
								
							<b>Teamwork skills:</b> Working with my teammate Maika remotely was a challenging but rewarding experience. Given that it is only the both of us, we had to delegate equally/fairly and really make sure we contribute our best to not let the other person down. Maika has a very high standard in terms of her work ethic and powerpoint design skills, which were fantastic to work with. I learned how to work effectively and deliver on time with my highly functioning teammate. It also taught me the power of “the whole should be greater than the sum of the individual parts” because our discussion led us to produce better ideas and solutions than we could have solved working by our own. Having the right teammate and being the right teammate ourselves, one who is respectful, hardworking, and responsible are vital traits to succeeding at work.</br></br>
								 
							<b>Problem solving skills:</b> The Humanitix case was challenging but brain-stimulating, it was like being thrown into the deep end of the ocean because like management consulting, I had to learn and solve problems in a completely new industry. Given Humanitix is the world's first not-for-profit ticketing platform (very unique organisation) and our case was mainly on scaling customer service as well as expansion to new cities, it was very exciting to undergo ample of Google research to learn about the industry as well as the problems we were solving. I really have to applaud Winnie and her team for crafting such high impactful and challenging questions, that once we were able to solve them, really upskilled us in our problem solving and creative thinking skills.</br></br>
								
							<b>Powerpoint & presentation skills:</b> As a management consultant or a professional in general, it is always very useful to know how to put together a well designed powerpoint and be able to synthesise our key findings/solutions into a couple of slides. I was lucky to have Maika, who is very apt in creating very clean and well-designed slides, to help in terms of the overall design of all our slides. I learned plenty in terms of what a simple, easy to understand, and information rich powerpoint slides look like. Also, it taught me the skill of taking all our in-depth research and deliver it effectively and concisely just through Powerpoint. I had to put in only the necessary and high value information in a format that is easily understood by the audience.</br></br>
								
							<h5>I would 100% encourage you to join YAPS’s CLAP program because of the extremely high quality of clients and problems you would help solve.</h5></br>

							Royston's Case Interview Tips
						</summary>
						<p>
							<h4>Case Interview Tips:</h4></br>
		
							Having spent over 100 hours and landing an internship at Bain this June, landing a job at a MBB firm or big 4/accenture is no easy feat.</br></br>
							
							It took me many hours to finally understand how to solve a case interview question properly, I was frustrated and confused in the beginning but the more hours I spent reading and learning, everything finally made sense. I'm here to pay it forward and make your life easier by sharing some tips and resources to go to.</br></br>
							
							There are many many many online resources on management consulting preparation, if you have time I would recommend dabbling and looking at all. But to start out with, I would recommend craftingcases.com as the best first place to learn from. Watch their youtube videos, read their blog posts, and take the free 7 day courses. Take plenty of notes and don't be afraid to rewatch the videos twice or thrice to really digest the content. That'll help you in most of the thing you need to know about management consulting. However after that, definitely explore other learning materials like Management Consulting Prep, Victor Cheng, etc.</br></br>
							
							In terms of resume, cover letter, and behavioural questions, I would recommend Rocket Block’s youtube channel and articles to start out with. And after that of course, any extra information you can get your hands on.</br></br>
							
							Additionally to reading and watching videos, there is a podcast by Firmsconsulting which has amazing free content that teaches you on almost everything you want to know about management consulting. Their youtube resources are also phenomenal as they are the only management consulting preparation company who uses solely partners to train candidates</br></br>
							
							One final word, landing a job at MBB is extremely difficult but achievable. You need to get everything right, from the resume & cover letter, to the behavioural questions, and then case interview questions. If you really want it bad enough, be ready to put in the crazy hours to keep reading, learning and never stop. Also another tip is to join your university’s consulting club. When I was in a study exchange at University of Southern California, I joined the USC Consulting Club which helped me a lot in terms of having people to practise cases with. At University of Melbourne for example, we also have our Melbourne University Consulting Club which you can also find me as Im involved as an executive committee.</br></br>
							
							Joining consulting clubs, especially YAPS because of the very high quality client and problems to solved, helped me in my resume writing and answering behavioural questions because I could share the many learnings and tough problems I was able to solve through YAPS.</br></br>
							
							It helps significantly if we can write out and share verbally on the learnings we gained. When I mentioned to my interviewer that i helped solved Humanitix, the world’s first NFP ticketing platform, multiple problems, it adds credibility to us that we have the capability and business acumen to solve a case as challenging as real life cases done by management consulting firms. Rest assured Winnie and her team at YAPS will continuously get both unique quality clients and problems for us to upskill ourselves.</br></br>
							
							Management consulting is definitely a great job to start off with because it teaches one to think structurally and critically, learn many different vertical & horizontal industries quickly, and most importantly there is a no a-hole rule. This rule means we have to learn to be friendly, kind, humble, respectful and supportive of others. There is no room for not being a good and nice person.</br></br>
							
							I wish you all the best and make sure you start early! Like 6 months - 1 year early before applying!</br></br>
